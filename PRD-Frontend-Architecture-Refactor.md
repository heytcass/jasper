# PRD: Jasper Frontend Architecture Refactor

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: July 23, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Owner**: Development Team  

---

## Executive Summary

### Vision
Transform Jasper's frontend architecture from an inefficient multi-process polling system to a proper daemon-centric architecture with modular frontend support, enabling seamless expansion to multiple desktop environments while dramatically improving performance and resource utilization.

### Current State Problems
- **Performance Degradation**: 3 waybar processes each run independent 30-second correlation analysis
- **Resource Waste**: 3x redundant analysis work every 15 minutes across all displays
- **Notification Spam**: Triple notifications requiring process-level locks as band-aid solution
- **Architecture Violation**: Frontend integrations bypass existing D-Bus daemon service
- **Scalability Blocker**: Hardcoded waybar integration prevents expansion to GNOME, KDE, etc.

### Business Impact
- **User Experience**: Faster, more responsive status updates (30s → <1s)
- **System Resources**: 67% reduction in CPU/memory usage (3x → 1x analysis)
- **Development Velocity**: Modular system enables rapid desktop environment expansion
- **Reliability**: Eliminates duplicate notifications and race conditions

---

## Problem Statement

### Primary Issues

1. **Inefficient Multi-Process Architecture**
   - Current: 3 waybar instances → 3 separate `jasper-companion-daemon waybar` calls
   - Each call runs full correlation analysis with 30-second timeout
   - Total system load: 3x analysis overhead every 15 minutes
   - Impact: High CPU usage, slow response times, resource contention

2. **Daemon Service Underutilization**
   - Existing D-Bus service (`org.personal.CompanionAI`) runs continuously
   - Performs analysis and maintains cache but isn't used by waybar
   - Waybar integration completely bypasses daemon architecture
   - Result: Duplicate analysis between daemon and waybar processes

3. **Notification System Issues**
   - Each waybar process triggers independent notifications
   - Result: 3 identical notifications for every insight update
   - Current fix: Process-level locks (technical debt/band-aid solution)
   - Problem: Notifications should come from daemon, not individual clients

4. **Frontend Extensibility Limitations**
   - Hardcoded waybar-specific logic in core systems
   - Adding GNOME Shell, KDE Plasma, or other frontends requires core modifications
   - No abstraction layer between data generation and presentation
   - Scaling blocker for multi-desktop environment support

### Root Cause Analysis
**Architectural Mismatch**: Frontend integrations implemented as direct CLI commands rather than clients of the background daemon service, violating proper daemon/client architecture patterns.
